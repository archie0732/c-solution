[題目連結](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-removing-substrings/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-12)



*　按照題意，然注意可以用`stack`解就ok了



## Code python3


```py
class Solution:
    def maximumGain(self, s: str, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        res = 0

        if y > x:
            first = "ba"
            first_score = y
            second = "ab"
            second_score = x
        else :
            first = "ab"
            first_score = x
            second = "ba"
            second_score = y

        first_stack: list[str] = []


        # ab  ==> a == "a"b
        #               ^   
        #               stack[-1]
        for c in s:
            if first_stack and c == first[1] and first_stack[-1] == first[0]:
                res+=first_score
                first_stack.pop()
            else:
                first_stack.append(c)
        
        second_stack: list[str] = []

        for c in first_stack:
            if second_stack and second_stack[-1] == second[0] and c == second[1]:
                res+=second_score
                second_stack.pop()
            else:
                second_stack.append(c)
        
        return res

```
